# Compute Moranâ€™s I statistic
# To quantify the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the model residuals
# Conduct a permutation test to assess its significance. 
# The permutation test has the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation and an alternative 
# hypothesis of positive spatial autocorrelation.
