## The Relations Between Strategic Plan EOs, Indicators and Datasources

**Visualization Note** First off, in order to see the interactive network, you will need to scroll on the visualization a little bit to center it within the frame. 

**Nodes** Now that you have it centered, you need to know a little about network analysis. All networks are composed of two core components: *nodes and ties*. In this network, the *nodes* correspond to two different entities. The deep red colored nodes are tenets were written in Fairfax County's Strategic Plan to promote the growth of economic opportunity. For short, we call these nodes EOs. The second type of node corresponds to indicators that have been used by other research institutions like [Broadstreet](https://www.broadstreet.io/board/BOARD/collection/Qm9hcmROb2RlOjI0ODE2/Food%20Access%20Report) to examine general trends about the population and resources in the county. 

**Colors** The bluish and greenish colored nodes are all indicators, but they are different colors because they refer to different data types. While the legend tells you the specifics, we wanted to simplify things since there are so many datasources. Dark blue nodes are datasets managed by the US government. The darker teal nodes are datasets managed by the state of Virginia or Fairfax County and the lighter turqoise nodes are datasources managed by private organizations. 

**Ties** When constructing this network, we wanted to know which indicators connect to each of the EOs. Below, the *ties* between the nodes show which indicators can help measure or better understand who could be affected by EO it shares a relation. As you play around with the visualization, there are a couple things that might help you orient this rather complex visualization. 

### Network 1: Baseline Results 

First, I would suggest mousing over all of the EOs to have some basis for what EOs are advocating. Once you have some familiarity, the next step is to hover over the indicators (in blue and green). You can that some indicators are really well connected, which you can more easily see by the *size* of the node. The most interesting part of the network is the collection of blue and green dots densely connected at the center of the graph. There, we can see that indicators like "Person Who Obtain Skills," "Persons With Improved Language Skills," and several demographic indicators all share connections to several EOs. These findings led us to some other questions (see below).

### Network 2: The Importance of Fairfax Datasources

The network visualized below is composed of the same nodes (EOs and indicators) and ties as the graph above. The only difference is that we have highlighted the Fairfax County datasets to show how central they are to pursuing a data-driven approach to EO implementation. In particular, Fairfax County's Health and Human Services data seems to offer a number of informative indicators that could us develop a composite index (or potentially policies) that address more than one EO at a time.

### Network 3: Using Network Analysis to Detect Indicator Clusters for Composite Indices

*Community Detection* Speaking of composite indices, there are also network statistics that can help us anlayze different clusters (or communities) of EOs and indicators. Using a community detection algorithm that calculates clusters based on a measure of similarity between nodes that is based on random walks throughout the network (see Pons and Latapy 2006). This analysis shows that there are four larger clusters of indicators that can help us potentially develop composite indices for our CommunityScapes that feed more directly into addressing the EOs. Take a look at these clusters below. 

**Which EOs cluster together?** The community detection method clustered five diffents sets of EOs. 

* The largest (deep red) community links EO4, EO5, E06, EO8, EO12, EO13, and EO15. These EOs mostly boil down to generating business growth and teaching more skills to workforce. The variables that are most connected to these EOs include population labels (of under-represented groups), persons who obtain job skills, persons who acquire English speaking skills, (un)employment variables, and variables about who own businesses. In essence, this cluster seems mostly to do with promoting economic mobility by supporting under-represented communities ownership of local businesses.  

* The second biggest cluster (in the darker teal color) is also related to economic mobility, but seems more focused on breaking down barriers and bolstering access to educational resources. The variables in this cluster almost all relate to reading profeciency, education level (e.g. having a GED or degree), and access to internet or other technology resources. 

* The third and fourth largest communities (in the lighter turquoise and light/dark blue colors) are mostly notable in that they are much less connected to the rest of the graphs. This tells us that the variables available us do not help us understand these EOs as much.
